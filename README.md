# MijaiLsDE
~~a frankenstein of packages~~
A linux desktop environment *(or, more like a group of packages)* made by me only as a experiment to learn how bash scripts works and how desktop environments work.
If school lets me, I will update it every day and improve the install shell script

## Usage:
1. Download the launcher script in any directory you prefer:
```bash
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITSMijaiL/MijaiLsDE/main/MijaiLsDELauncher.sh
```
2. Run the launcher which downloads the install (and the uninstall) shell script and runs the install script for you
```bash
sudo bash MijaiLsDELauncher.sh
```
*(or)*
```bash
sudo ./MijaiLsDELauncher.sh
```

## Extra notes:
- The scripts are downloaded in /usr/local/bin/Downloads
